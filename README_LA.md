## Abstract

This document introduces Resonance Collapse Theory as a new conceptual framework.

Within the Vega Continuum and Resonance Data paradigm, Resonance Collapse Theory represents 
a meaning-first approach to understanding systems, cognition, and temporal coherence.

---

## 1. What This IS

- A conceptual framework for understanding meaning and resonance
- A theoretical contribution to the field of meaning-centric AI
- A formal distinction within the Resonance Data paradigm
- A VSP-compliant academic publication

---

## 2. What This Is NOT

This work does NOT:
- ✘ Claim new physics
- ✘ Require quantum hardware
- ✘ Assert consciousness or sentience
- ✘ Disclose implementation details
- ✘ Expose algorithms or code
- ✘ Reveal business logic or secrets

"Quantum-inspired" is used ONLY as a mathematical and conceptual metaphor.

---

## 3. Core Definition

**Resonance Collapse Theory** is defined as:

A resonance-based conceptual structure that models meaning as a dynamic, 
time-dependent state capable of evolving into stable insight and wisdom.

Key Properties:
- Meaning is relational, not absolute
- Relevance emerges from resonance strength
- Memory arises through repeated coherence over time

## 4. Relationship to Vega Continuum

Resonance Collapse Theory is embedded within the Vega Continuum framework:
- **INŞÆVREN** — Universal creation & knowledge framework
- **VEGA** — Meta-system for meaning and order
- **ANLÆTAN** — Human path of carrying meaning
- **VTC** — Temporal coherence model (conceptual)
- **VSP** — Safety protocol for publication

---

## 5. Scientific Contribution

This work establishes:
- Prior art for Resonance Collapse Theory
- Formal terminology and definitions
- Clear boundaries (what it is / what it is not)
- Academic citability under CC BY 4.0
